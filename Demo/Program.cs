            //event is a way for a class to notify other classes (subscribers) when something happens. It uses a delegate to define the method signature for the event handlers.
            //The publisher class raises the event, and subscribers handle it with their methods. Events are commonly used in the publisher-subscriber model for communication between
            //objects.
